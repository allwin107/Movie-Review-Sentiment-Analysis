        "  * example: 681 original words → 147 meaningful words\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Reduction: ~79% reduction (this is good and expected)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Why this is good: Removes noise while keeping sentiment-bearing words\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Typical range: Most reviews will reduce by 75-85%\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Which preprocessing step removes the most content?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Stop words removal: Biggest impact - removes ~40-50% of remaining words\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Eliminated words like: \"the\", \"and\", \"is\", \"of\", \"in\", \"to\", \"it\", \"was\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Text cleaning: Removes punctuation, numbers, HTML tags (~10-15%)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Final filtering: Removes short words and non-alphabetic tokens (~5-10%)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Contraction expansion: Actually adds meaningful words back (\"I'd\" → \"would\")\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Do positive and negative reviews have different word patterns after preprocessing?\n",
        "\n",
        "  * negative review contained words like:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * \"controversial\", \"shocking\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    * \"cheaply\", \"kill\" (as in \"kills me\")\n",
        "\n",
        "  * But also some neutral/analytical words: \"documentary\", \"political\", \"artistic\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Positive reviews typically contain:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * \"amazing\", \"fantastic\", \"excellent\"\n",

        "\n",
        "    * \"perfect\", \"wonderful\", \"incredible\"\n",

        "#### **My Text Preprocessing Pipeline:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 0 - Contraction Handling:** Words like \"I'd\" become \"I\" and \"d\" after cleaning. I remove single characters (length ≤ 2) in the final step because they don't contribute to sentiment analysis. This is a common and acceptable approach in NLP preprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1 - Text Cleaning:** I remove HTML tags and URLs because they don't contain sentiment information and can confuse the model. Special characters and punctuation are removed to standardize the text format.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2 - Tokenization:** I split text into individual words because machine learning models work with individual tokens, not continuous text. This allows the model to analyze each word's contribution to sentiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3 - Stop Words:** I remove common words like \"the\", \"and\", \"is\" because they appear in both positive and negative reviews equally and don't indicate sentiment. This reduces noise and focuses on meaningful words.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4 - Lemmatization:** I convert words to their base forms (e.g., \"films\" → \"film\") because different forms of the same word should be treated equally. This reduces vocabulary size and improves model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this helps ML:** Clean, standardized text helps the model focus on sentiment-bearing words rather than formatting inconsistencies. Reduced vocabulary size means faster training and better generalization to new reviews."

        "  * **Direct Classification:** Confidence scores ranged from 0.85-0.95 for clear cases, dropped to 0.60-0.75 for ambiguous reviews\n",

        "  * **Few-Shot Learning**: More consistent confidence scores (0.80-0.90 range), less variation between different review types\n",

        "\n",
        "  * Clear Positive Reviews (e.g., \"Amazing movie! Loved it!\"):\n",
        "\n",
        "    * All three variations performed equally well (95%+ accuracy)\n",

        "  * **Few-shot**: ~0.3 seconds per review (longer prompt processing)\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
